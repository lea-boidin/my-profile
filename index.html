				<p> 
					I am 19 and I come from Montpellier (south of France). I am studying Management on the Lille campus of IÉSEG. I moved to the United States in 2016 and lived in Philadelphia for 2 years and in Washigton D.C. for 1 year. Traveling, meeting people coming from all over the world and learning about other cultures are some of my passions.

				<h2>My Expatriation : Philadelphia</h2>
				<p>
					I arrived in Philly when I was 15 and finished my last two years of high school at Harriton High School. I graduated in 2018 with the International Baccalaureate Diploma. I met students coming from Brazil, Iran, India, etc and learned a lot about American culture.

				<h2>My Expatriation 2.0 : Washington D.C.</h2>
				<p>
					I studied at the George Washington University for 1 year from 2018 to 2019. International Business was my major, I loved the GW Business School and made many new friends. GW Women in Business is a wonderful group of women on campus that I joined. We organized a conference with around 500 attendees on the theme of "Transform and Transcend". Learning how to communicate with company managers and potential sponsors for our event was enriching and enlightening.

				<h2>Passions</h2>
				<p> Born in a family of travel lovers, I had the chance to visit many places and meet interesting and lovely people. Thanks to these experiences, I became more open-minded and learned how to adjust to a new culture. Some other passions of mine are modern-jazz dance which I have practiced for 10 years and listening to music. </p>
